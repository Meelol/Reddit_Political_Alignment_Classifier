    "This notebook focuses on extracting **political debate data** from Reddit using the **Reddit API**. The goal is to gather a dataset of **comments** from political subreddits that will be used for exploratory data analysis (EDA), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and ultimately, model building.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is done within the **U.S. political context**, where political ideologies and classifications are based on **American political alignments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data collection process includes:\n",
    "1. **Accessing the Reddit API**: Using **PRAW** (Python Reddit API Wrapper) to interact with Reddit's data.\n",
    "2. **Extracting posts from specific political debate subreddits**: We'll collect posts from political subreddits such as: </br></br>\n",
    "   - **r/AskALiberal**\n",
    "   - **r/AskConservatives**\n",
    "   - **r/AskPolitics**\n",
    "   - **r/AskTrumpSupporters**\n",
    "     </br></br>\n",
    "3. **Capturing user flairs**: We will also capture **user flairs** (the labels or tags that users have set on their profiles), which will be used to classify the **political leaning** of the comments to either: </br></br>\n",
    "    - **Democrat-aligned (0)**\n",
    "    - **Republican-aligned (1)**\n",
    "</br></br>\n",
    "4. Data Extracted: For each post and comment, we will extract the following fields:\n",
    "- **comment_id**: The unique identifier for the Reddit comment. \n",
    "- **post_id**: The unique identifier for the Reddit post where comments come from.\n",
    "- **subreddit**: The subreddit from which the post/comment is extracted.\n",
    "- **text**: The content of the post or comment.\n",
    "- **flair**: The user’s flair (if available) that may indicate political alignment or other user-defined information.\n",
    "- **political alignment**: The target classification, either Democrat-aligned (0) or Republican-aligned (1), based on the user flair."

      "Keep seeing this whole \"Democrats are defending Venezuelan r\\*pist murderer gang members\" BS in the conservative and askconservatives subs when people raise alarm about these dehumanizing deportations. I've been trying to explain that with no evidence to prove they are any of those things and no opportunity for them to prove their innocence, there's no way to know they are a \"r\\*pist, murderer, or gang member\". I've tried explaining that with no due process, anyone can point to a random person and say they're an illegal immigrant gang member and have them disappeared to a de facto concentration camp. Actually getting this idea through to conservatives and explaining why it's bad has been about as effective as trying to teach my cat how to program a robot.\n",

      "Post: Why do progressives argue that the party should move left to inspire increased turnout when polls show that 80% of this country identify as either conservative or moderate and politically disengaged voters would vote for Trump?\n",
      "[This is Why Kamala Harris really lost](https://www.vox.com/politics/403364/tik-tok-young-voters-2024-election-democrats-david-shor)\n",
      "\n",
      ">And when you do that, you see that roughly 30 percent of the change in Democratic vote share from 2020 to 2024 was changes in who voted — changes in turnout. But the other 70 percent was people changing their mind. And that’s in line with the breakdown we’ve seen for most elections in the past 30 years.\n",
      "\n",
      ">The reality is that these things always tend to move in the same direction — parties that lose ground with swing voters tend to simultaneously see worse turnout. And for a simple reason. There were a lot of Democratic voters who were angry at their party last year. **And they were mostly moderate and conservative Democrats angry about the cost of living and other issues.** And even though they couldn’t bring themselves to vote for a Republican, a lot of them stayed home. But basically, their complaints were very similar to those of Biden voters who flipped to Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      ">**The reality is if all registered voters had turned out, then Donald Trump would’ve won the popular vote by 5 points [instead of 1.7 points]. So, I think that a “we need to turn up the temperature and mobilize everyone” strategy would’ve made things worse.**\n",
      "\n",
      ">Politically disengaged voters went from being a roughly neutral group in 2020 to favoring the Republicans by about 15 points in 2024. But during the Obama era, this was a solidly Democratic group, favoring us by between 10 and 15 points. \n",
      "\n",
      ">To move beyond the why, this shift in the partisanship of politically disengaged voters has a really important implication: For most of the last 15 years, we’ve really lived in this world where the mantra was “If everybody votes, we win.” But we’re now at a point where the more people vote, the better Republicans do.\n",
      "\n",
      ">**Fundamentally, 40 percent of the country identifies as conservative. Roughly 40 percent is moderate, 20 percent is liberal**, though it depends exactly how you ask it. Sometimes it’s 25 percent liberal. But the reality is that, to the extent that Democrats try to polarize the electorate on self-described ideology, this is just something that plays into the hands of Republicans.\n",
      "\n",
      "2024 was a persuasion election, a lot of moderates were convinced to vote for Trump for a whole host of issues. There was a lot of Biden 2020 -> Trump 2024 voters. The Democrats who stayed home were moderate and conservative Democrats, not leftists unhappy with the party for not being sufficiently left-enough. Trump did not win due to decreased to turnout from leftists cause of Gaza or other reasons. Kamala Harris did just as well with white liberals, white moderates and white conservatives as Hillary Clinton did in 2016. However, Trump made big gains with minorities, (a lot of whom identify or identified as conservative Democrats) and feel the Democratic party is too far left.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that progressives want the party to move left and like to post opinion polls showing how progressive policy is popular even though support for progressive policies collapse when you elaborate the plan. However the reality is the reason why Democrats are losing people is cause most voters (including the base) see them as too far left.\n",

      "Post: Are there media campaigns to help turn public opinion against Trump\n",
      "I am disgusted by the Trump administration's actions that are far beyond anything that I imagined and I feel tremendous despair and helplessness to resist.  I think this hits so hard to me because I believe so strongly in institutions — flawed as they always are.  Alana Newhouse argued that an important divide is between the status quo and the \"brokenists\". (https://archive.is/2x350)\n",
      "\n",
      "For me, to see institutions collapse is a reason for grief.  Stable institutions keep an economy growing, keep services operating for the needy, keep critical dialog happening in universities, provide legal bulwarks against corruption, etc.  Institutions also embody ideas that while frequently flawed are important for a liberal society — e.g., the US as a symbol of freedom and justice, the statue of liberty asks for the tired and poor, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "And of course Trump's lack of probity, the patrimonialism in which he operates, and the singular power that he claims has already led to abhorrent results ranging from deaths due to the withdrawal of foreign aid to the detention of political prisoners without due process.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that long-winded preface is to say that much of what has transpired since Jan 20 is not supported by most Americans.  I can imagine why voters chose Trump — contingents of brokenists who feel that government has failed them, hindered progress, or indoctrinated. But it seems clear to me that almost all of Trump and Musk's actions so far would be very unpopular if examined with even a modicum of critical thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also seems clear to me that the only ways to resist Trump are through lawfare and public pressure.  The Republicans in Congress have abdicated their responsibilities, the Democrats are impotent and rudderless, and the chance of turning the House seems very remote.  I'm not sure why, but I don't see organizations like the Women's March re-surfacing or large scale protests like I joined in the lead-up to the Iraq invasion.  Unlike in other countries, I don't see labor organizing crippling strikes.  And in any case, I worry that Trump will eagerly invoke the Insurrection Act at the first sign of raucous protest.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think that the most impactful resistance strategy is to turn more Americans against Trump, rather than rally those of us who are already against him.  I know that polls show majority disapproval for much of what has transpired.  But is there any organized effort to change public opinion?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am imagining a media campaign that targets demographics that likely voted for Trump or didn't vote.  It might have a common theme like \"Not so great\" or \"I didn't vote for that\".  It wouldn't be tied to a political campaign.  And it wouldn't necessarily send someone to a website or be affiliated with a known political organization.  Instead, it would sow a sense of unease and doubt among Americans who live in cultures where thinking contrary to the political right is not generally imaginable.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dream media campaign wouldn't touch topics like trans-rights, Palestinian protesters or deportations without due process — all horrendous concerns, but ones that aren't strategic.  Instead, I would focus on corruption and personal loss.  Corruption causes universal disgust and Trump and Musk are blatantly corrupt.  And personal loss, i.e. topics that hit home affecting individual well-being, have obvious salience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Corruption examples might include things like Trump appointing an industry lobbyist to regulate baby formula, Trump firing inspectors, Trump promoting Tesla cars at the White House — all blatantly unethical.  Personal loss might be a farmer's grant that wasn't paid after they did the work, a farmer who lost a USAID food contract after planting the crop, a vet whose VA doctor was fired, and so on.  \n",
      "\n",
      "To contrast my vision, The Lincoln Project, for example, does *not* seem like the right strategy.  It specializes in hard hitting attack ads and is very beltway political.  Instead I'm imagining something like Instagram shorts or YouTube interstitial ads that lead with patriotic themes or appealing footage like national parks or a church group engaged in outreach, and then pivot to something related that shows how the viewers' values are under assault.  I think attack ads or strongly messaged calls for political action will be dismissed, but ads that leave the viewer feeling uneasy, concerned, or questioning would hit the mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who is engaged in this sort of effort?  What groups need support?  How could a media campaign get noticed by the right people?  What format would be effective? \n",

      "Post: Sanders was one of the strongest proponents student loan forgiveness in 2020, yet today the policy is seen as an example of how Biden Democrats were out-of-touch with non-college attending working class. What happened?\n",
      "Way back in the 2020 Democratic primaries, part of the Sanders' higher ed policy was to forgive all [$2.2 trillion.](https://berniesanders.com/issues/free-college-cancel-debt/) His proposal was basically to use the Secretary of Ed's authority to forgive all loans. Zoom to 2022 and Biden attempts to partially forgive student loans with an executive action, which is overturned by the Supreme Court. In 2023, he attempts to do partial loan forgiveness through DoE programs and ended up forgiving about $183 billion. I think there were also other plans to strengthen existing student debt relief plans too.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the 2024 election, there was criticism that these student loan relief programs were a sign how the Democrats only cared about college educated people and not working class people (that did not and weren't planning to go to college). But this was an issue Sanders' popularized and pushed for. So, my question is why did it end up becoming an anchor around Biden (and Harris') neck?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it because $183 billion fell far short of the $2.2 trillion total (and not to mention the other aspects of Sanders' college plan including free college that was not done)? Or was it a complete mistake and there should have been no loan forgiveness at all? Or was there something else?\n",

      "Let’s break this down with a scenario: a row of brand-new Cybertrucks parked at a dealership or mass storage lot, say 5-10 vehicles, tightly packed as they often are for display or shipping prep. If one Cybertruck’s battery undergoes thermal runaway and explodes, the danger depends on propagation (whether it triggers neighboring trucks), the explosion’s scale, and the layout of the site.\n",
      "\n",
      "Danger to People at the Dealership\n",
      "If a single Cybertruck battery explodes, the immediate \"kill zone\" is likely 20-50 feet, as estimated earlier. Dealership staff or customers within this radius—say, inspecting vehicles or walking through the lot—face severe risk: fatal burns from temperatures exceeding 1,000°C, shrapnel from battery casings or the truck’s steel exoskeleton, and a pressure wave strong enough to rupture eardrums or cause blunt trauma. The Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion on January 1, 2025, showed a contained blast due to external combustibles, but a battery-driven explosion could be more energetic. Beyond 50 feet, up to 100-150 feet, injuries drop to burns, inhalation of toxic gases (like hydrogen fluoride), or cuts from debris, assuming no secondary explosions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real kicker is propagation. Lithium-ion battery fires can spread to adjacent vehicles if heat triggers thermal runaway in nearby Cybertrucks. At a dealership, where trucks might be parked just 3-5 feet apart, a domino effect isn’t far-fetched—think of the 2021 Tesla Model S fire in Shanghai that damaged nearby cars, or EV charging station incidents where fires jumped. If 5-10 Cybertrucks ignite and explode in sequence, the kill zone expands. A rough guess, scaling from single-EV fire studies, puts a multi-truck blast’s lethal radius at 100-200 feet, with a danger zone (serious injury) stretching 300-500 feet. People inside the dealership building, maybe 50-100 feet from the lot, could face shattered windows, toxic smoke infiltration, or structural collapse if the blast is big enough.\n",
      "Danger to Vehicles Driving By\n",
      "For cars passing the dealership—say, on a road 50-200 feet away—the risk depends on distance and timing. At 50 feet, a single Cybertruck explosion could hurl shrapnel (battery fragments, glass, or steel) into traffic, potentially piercing windshields or fuel tanks, with heat intense enough to ignite nearby combustibles. Drivers might suffer injuries like cuts or burns, and a pressure wave could disorient them, risking crashes. The Las Vegas case showed debris stayed close, but a battery explosion might throw hazards farther—up to 150 feet based on EV incident patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "If multiple Cybertrucks blow, the danger spikes. A 200-foot radius could easily reach a road, especially near urban dealerships. Shrapnel and heat could disable vehicles, ignite fuel, or cause pileups if drivers panic. Toxic gases drifting into traffic pose a subtler threat—inhalation could impair drivers over minutes, not seconds. Speed matters too: a car at 30 mph covers 44 feet per second, so someone 200 feet away might escape the worst if they’re moving when the blast hits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantifying the Risk\n",
      "Single Explosion: 20-50 foot kill zone, 150-foot injury radius. Dealership folks near the truck are toast; drivers 100+ feet away might dodge serious harm unless debris clips them.\n",
      "Multi-Truck Cascade: 100-200 foot kill zone, 500-foot danger zone. Half the dealership could be a death trap, and a busy road within 200-300 feet risks wrecked cars and injured drivers. Firefighting gets dicey too—EV battery fires resist suppression, prolonging the chaos.\n",
      "\n",
      "No public data models this exact scenario for Cybertrucks, but extrapolating from EV fire studies (e.g., NFPA guidelines) and the Cybertruck’s beefy build, the stainless-steel frame might contain some force, but packed batteries amplify the outcome. Dealerships near highways or dense lots are powder kegs if this goes off—less so for isolated rural sites. Either way, it’s a mess you’d want to be far from.\n",

      "Some examples:\n",

      "\n",
      "I often hear a lot of conservatives say things along the lines of.....\"We're not opposed to immigration, we're only opposed to illegal immigration\". However recent events like the H-1B debate have clearly showed that this isn't the case at all. Although I don't believe they're a majority of conservatives, there seems to be an enormous and growing amount of conservatives that oppose ALL immigration both legal and illegal. Ann coulter, Steve Banon, and many more have been very vocal about opposing any form of immigration. These figures are not in anyway fringe figures as they each have audiences to the amount of millions of listeners. If figures like Steve banon or Ann coulter were to craft immigration policies, not even Elon Musk would've been allowed to become a naturalized citizen. Steve Banon even went as far as calling Elon Musk - a \"parasitic illegal immigrant\" even though Musk, a former H-1B visa holder is not only the most successful immigrant in US history but there is precisely ZERO evidence he ever broke any immigration law. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are widely believed lies on both sides but the idea that people on the right as a group are only opposed to illegal immigration and are not opposed to legal immigration is probably the most widely believed lie on the right.\n",

      "I understand that there are genuinely bigoted people they intend to shut down, but it defeats the purpose if they are going to come off as condescending, privileged, and elitist by essentially making people feel like they don't belong in their communities because they make it clear they don't approve of how they speak or who they are as people by constantly nitpicking at what people say just because it can be \"seen as offensive\" regardless of whether that person is actually trying to offend anyone or said anything truly morally wrong, or calling people  \"stupid\" or \"dumb\" because they didn't have the luxury of being educated, all things typical of people that are  poor or marginalized, which in turn doesn't make them seem like a very inclusive or populist party if they exclude people over things they should be more understanding and willing to communicate over that they can't control to most people not into politics. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, this and being hostile towards people they perceive to have power over marginalized groups regardless of whether those people belong to marginalized groups themselves, which is often the case (men, Caucasians, etc). What I mean by this simply is that most Americans are not rich, meaning that most belong to a marginalized group in being working class in and of themselves, and even if they are rich, there could be a pretty good chance they are POC, women, or have a mental illness or disability, which makes being hostile towards them contradict what they're against, which still does not make much sense to me. \n",

      "Post: Conservatives, why do you oppose the implementation of universal healthcare?\n",
      "Universal healthcare would likely replace Medicare, Medicaid, and other health programs with a single entity that covers all medical and pharmaceutical costs. This means every American would benefit from the program, rather than just those with preexisting conditions, the elderly, the disabled, and the poor. Many of the complaints I have heard from conservatives about the ACA focus on rising premiums, but a universal healthcare system would significantly reduce the role of private insurance, effectively lowering most individual out-of-pocket medical expenses. Yes, a universal healthcare program would require higher tax revenue, but couldn’t the payroll tax wage cap be removed to help fund it? Also, since Medicaid is funded by a combination of federal and state income tax revenue and would be absorbed into universal coverage, those funds could be reallocated to support the new system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another complaint I have heard about universal healthcare is the claim that it would decrease the quality of care since there would be less financial competition among doctors and pharmaceutical companies. However, countries like Canada and the Nordic nations statistically experience better healthcare outcomes than the U.S. in key areas such as life expectancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do you, as a conservative, oppose universal healthcare, and what suggestions would you make to improve our current broken healthcare system?\n",

      ">The Washington Post changed the headline of its obituary of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Sunday after facing backlash for calling him an “austere religious scholar.” Vice President of Communications at Washington Post Kristine Coratti Kelly said in a tweet that “the headline should never have read that way and we changed it quickly.” The first version of the article described Baghdadi as the “Islamic State’s terrorist-in-chief,” before it was changed to “austere religious scholar.” It’s unclear why the newspaper initially changed the headline, but it was changed for a third time to its current headline: “Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, extremist leader of Islamic State, dies at 48.” President Trump confirmed Sunday that U.S. forces killed Baghdadi during a raid in northern Syria the day before.\n",

      "Since the election, we’ve had a large increase in the number of posts that are submitted daily. Each post is manually reviewed prior to going live or being rejected. You can view a more in depth submissions style guide at the link provided but we just wanted to pin a refresher post for any new comers (or old hands who have forgotten). A couple quick points that will dramatically improve your post’s chances of being approved:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Include sources in your post body to relevant information, preferably as hyper links in appropriate places. Link to sources with as neutral a tone as possible, factual context is what we’re looking for here. BLS >> Mother Jones etc\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Providing lots of context in the question body is encouraged. Providing lots of opinionated rhetoric that you think is context is discouraged. If you are not sure of your ability to distinguish between those two things, it’s best to keep your question short and sweet. A short and pointed question with even a single citation for additional context will always do much better than a long question that reads like an activist speech. \n",
      "\n",
      "We tend to approve about 5-8 topics per day in order to keep conversations directed. There is room for variation there but that’s the typical range. If you see that your post was rejected please review it and compare it to the posting guide to see where it may be deficient and try to improve it before trying again. It may be true that it was just a busy day and a total resubmission might work on another day. \n",
